# HR-Attrition

This report provides an in-depth analysis of employee attrition based on a publicly available HR dataset from [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset?resource=download)). The focus is on identifying key factors contributing to employee turnover within the organization.

> This project was created **entirely in Power BI**, using **Power Query** for data transformation.  
> From the raw dataset, I structured a proper data model by creating **dimension tables** and a **fact table** to enable effective filtering and insight extraction.
